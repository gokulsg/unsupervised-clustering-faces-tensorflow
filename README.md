## Description
Project Oversight is a robust, enterprise grade multi-tasking convolutional neural net based framework optimized for speed and performance. The following are its features:

  - Video Indexing
  - Frame Analysis
  - Face Detection
  - Face Cropping
  - Image Optimization
  - Noise Reduction
  - Embedding Generation
  - Euclidean Difference Calculation
  - Clustering
  - Notifications with Twilio Integration with SMS and Whatsapp

## Inspiration
This project is greatly inspired from the Sandberg Paper called Google FaceNet, thereby harnessing Google's whitepaper implementations and applying them for real world production ready use cases and environments as a robust solution

* [Google's Facenet] - Face Embeddings whitepapers

### Technology

Oversight uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Tensorflow] - A google open-source ML framework
* [Python] - awesome language we love

### Environment Setup

##### This was build on Windows 10.

These were the pre-requisities :

##### NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit
* [CUDA] - parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general computing on graphical processing units (GPUs). Download and Install all the patches. During install, choose Custom and uncheck the Visual Studio Integration checkbox.

##### Download cuDNN
* [cuDNN] - The NVIDIA CUDAÂ® Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN) is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks. Create a NVIDIA developer account to download.

##### Set Path :
Add the following paths,
&nbsp;
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v9.0\bin
&nbsp;
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v9.0\libnvvp
&nbsp;
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v9.0\bin\extras\CUPTI\libx64

##### Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) with 3.6 x64

```sh
$ conda update conda
```

##### Run package installer

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Install C/C++ Build tools

* [C/C++ Build Tools] - Custom librarires required to build C based implementations to Python runnable builds

#### Download Pre-Trained Model

* [Pretrained Model] - A trained CNN by Google whose bottleneck needs to be consumed. Put this .pb file in the *20170512-110547* folder

#### Installation

Oversight requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.6+ to run.

###### IMPORTANT STEP 1 : Goto send_message.py and replace required Authentication Tokens for Twilio Notifications.

###### IMPORTANT STEP 2 : Place your Video in /uploads and replace filename of video in webcam_detect.py


```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/pourabkarchaudhuri/unsupervised-clustering-faces-tensorflow.git
$ cd unsupervised-clustering-faces-tensorflow
$ python cluster.py
```

### Todos

 - Optimize Further to increase speed
 - Implement Docker and Jenkins based deployment
